Job Application Tracker - Mini SRS

Purpose:
Provide job seekers a simple, local application to track job applications, statuses, notes, and interview events. Focus on data privacy and input sanitization.

Functional Requirements:
- User authentication (Django admin / local accounts)
- CRUD operations for job application records (create, read, update, delete)
- Fields: company, role, application_date, status, notes
- Search/filter by company and status
- Export/import CSV (optional)

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Use SQLite for local persistence
- Responsive UI (basic Django templates)
- Secure input handling to prevent injection and XSS
- Appropriate logging for auth events

Constraints:
- Single-node deployment for lab (minikube)
- No external DB; use SQLite
- Run in Docker and Kubernetes for lab

Acceptance Criteria:
- Able to register and login, create and view job entries
- All user inputs sanitized and displayed safely (no raw HTML rendering)
- Container builds successfully and app runs at / on port 8000
- Kubernetes deployment exposes app via Service and pod(s) run
